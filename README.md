CIFAR-100 Image Classification with ResNet50 Transfer Learning
This project implements image classification on the CIFAR-100 dataset using transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet50 model. 

The model achieves improved performance by leveraging features learned from ImageNet and fine-tuning them for the specific task of classifying 100 different object categories.
